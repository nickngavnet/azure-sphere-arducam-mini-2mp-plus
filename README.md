﻿# ArduCAM mini 2MP Plus SPI camera 

This sample demonstrates capturing a JPEG picture using [ArduCAM mini 2MP PLUS]() SPI camera on Azure Sphere OS and upload the picture to Azure Blob service using libcurl to initiate [Put Blob](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/put-blob) REST API with [SAS authorization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/delegate-access-with-shared-access-signature). 

## Configure Azure Blob and generate service SAS

1. To run this demo you need have a [storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account?tabs=azure-portal) and create a [blob container](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal)
2. Download [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/) and login with your Azure AD
3. In Storage Explorer, navigate to your container icon and right click to **Get Shared Access Signature**, create a Ad-hoc Service SAS with at least *Create* and *Write* permission. Copy **Query String**

## To build and run the sample

### Prep your device

1. Ensure that your Azure Sphere device is connected to your PC, and your PC is connected to the internet.
2. Even if you've performed this set up previously, ensure that you have Azure Sphere SDK version 19.09 or above. In an Azure Sphere Developer Command Prompt, run **azsphere show-version** to check. Download and install the [latest SDK](https://aka.ms/AzureSphereSDKDownload) as needed.
3. Open Azure Sphere Developer Command Prompt and issue the following command:

   ```
   azsphere dev edv
   ```
4. The demo is tested on RDB, connect SPI to ISU1 on Header 4 and I2C to ISU0 on Header 2. Detailed connections are:
   
    |  ArduCAM mini 2MP Plus | RDB  | MT3620 |
    |  ----  | ----  | ---- | 
    | SCL  | H2-7 | GPIO27_MOSI0_RTS0_CLK0 |
    | SDA  | H2-1 | GPIO28_MISO0_RXD0_DATA0 | 
    | VCC  | H3-3 | 3V3 |
    | GND  | H3-2 | GND |
    | SCK  | H4-7 | GPIO31_SCLK1_TXD1 |
    | MISO  | H4-5 | GPIO33_MISO1_RXD1_DATA1 |
    | MOSI  | H4-11 | GPIO32_MOSI1_RTS1_CLK1 |
    | CS   | H1-10 | GPIO3 |
  
### Build and deploy the application

1. Start Visual Studio.
2. Select the file azure-sphere-libcurl-blob.sln and then click **Open**. 
3. In main.c file, replace FileURI string with your **stroage account name** and SASToken string with your **Query String** created.
4. In app_manifest.json file, fill your own **stroage account name** in AllowedConnections capability. 
5. Press **F5** to build and debug the application
6. In **Device Output** window, you will observe below logs:
